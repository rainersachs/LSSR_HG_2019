# Purpose:      Concerns radiogenic mouse Harderian gland tumorigenesis. Loads 
#               ion and tumor prevalence data from CSV files. It is part of the 
#               source code for the Harderian Gland LSSR project.

# Data used in 16Chang; includes data analyzed in .93Alp and .94Alp. Does not 
# include gamma-ray data. Includes LET=100 keV/micron for Ti, an ad-hoc 
# compromise between lower value at beam entry and higher value at mouse cage.

# The next few lines plus the CSV file (which will need work as 
# additions and perhaps corrections come up) should be all we need.

# The following, which shows how to compute ion speed and the Katz 
# amorphous track structure parameter, may be used for adding Cucinotta's 
# models in 16 Chang to our scripts and comparing them to our more 
# parsimonious models.

# GeVu is kinetic energy per atomic mass unit. An example for 
# 670Ne20 is GeVu = 10^-3*670.

# The calculations here can and will approximate Z_eff by Z, 
# e.g. Z_eff = 10 for Ne.

# Katz = 1/round(Z^2 * (2.57 * GeVu^2 + 4.781 * GeVu + 2.233) / 
# (2.57 * GeVu^2 + 4.781 * GeVu), 3) 

# Special relativistic calculation of Z^2 / beta^2. The numerics include 
# conversion from GeV to joules and from u to kg.

# beta_star = Z * round(sqrt(1 / Katz), 3) 
# i.e. beta = Z * sqrt(beta^2 / Z^2).
